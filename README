PREREQUISITES
-------------

ImageMagic needs to be installed
PHP 5.3 needs to be installed
Osmosis needs to be in ../osmosis-latest/bin (as binary name "osmosis")
You need to have a full rendering stack setup...
You can only start use this before the changes happen.

SETUP
-----

1. Rename config.txt.example to config.txt, and edit config.txt. The format
   needs to be exactly like it is!
   Also make sure that LAT1 < LAT2 and LON1 < LON2.
   The bounding box for "osmosis" needs to be about twice as large as 
   the bounding box for "edits" (through LAT1, LAT2, LON1, LON2)
2. Run ./setup.sh
3. Get a matching state file from
   http://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/minute
   Typically one that's a day from before the time for the planet file and
   save it as "state.txt"
4. Edit "configuration.txt" and make it:

	baseUrl=http://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/minute
	maxInterval = 900

5. run "./update.sh" once to make check whether it works.

Repeat this until the end of the mapping period.

Then to create the video:

1. Put a 900x472 pixel image in config/title-image.jpg
2. run (in the root): ./create-artwork.sh
3. run ./generate.sh
